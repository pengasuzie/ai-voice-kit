Here's your daily briefing for Tuesday.

Revenue is tracking twelve percent above forecast this quarter. The sales team closed three new enterprise deals last week, bringing our total pipeline to two point four million.

Two items need your attention today. First, the product team wants sign-off on the new onboarding flow. The A.B. test results show a twenty-three percent improvement in activation rate. Second, your three o'clock with the Meridian Group has been moved to four fifteen. They want to discuss expanding the pilot to their Sydney office.

On the competitive front, Acme Corp announced a new pricing tier yesterday. It undercuts our starter plan by about fifteen percent, but their feature set is still limited compared to ours. No immediate action needed, but worth monitoring.

That's your briefing. Have a good day.
